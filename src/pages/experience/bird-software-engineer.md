While at Bird I worked in a mission team building, testing, and sunsetting, billion dollar ideas outside of the core business. 

* Our engineering team had two iOS engineers, two Android engineers, and two full-stack engineers (I'm one of these two). 
* We worked fast, sometimes transforming ideas from our product manager into code ready for the next release just a few hours after introduction to the team.

On this team, I focused on BirdPay, a QR-based payment platform integrated with the Bird app, and the renters/owners program at Bird.

* During the initial safer at home orders the city of Santa Monica published a map of essential businesses. As an alternative to operations associates copying the information from the map manually, I traced the source of this map to write a script that uploaded 127 businesses to BirdPay for user visibility

Outside of my mission team, I participated fiercely in the larger engineering organization goals.

* Facilitated several full-stack guild meetings, and readily filled in for absent facilitators
* Spent Fridays working with Engineering leadership on tickets designed to reduce costs or speed up development in less than four hours of work
* Placed 3rd in an internal hackathon on my 5th day at work! - the prize was a jacket with "Hacktober 2019" on it

Stack was: Kotlin, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, Ruby, Python;
