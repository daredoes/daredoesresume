When I originally joined Fair I was hired as a back-end engineer on the billing team. When I finished at Fair, I was leading a team of engineers on the creation of an internal operations website. While this transition was not entirely my choice, I embraced the opportunity to grow my skillset in a wider capacity.

* While on Billing team I worked with a team of 4-6 engineers on supporting the existing business
* While on the Customer Fleet Management (CFM) team I worked with a team of 5-10 engineers on supporting the existing business, and supporting the pivot to a new business

The team of engineers under my supervision on CFM team consisted of two-to-five, on average three, front-end international contractors. They pushed me forward in my journey of being able to manage others, and I hope I was able to push them forward in their journey's as engineers.

Throughout my time at Fair I championed changes in the company big and small, cultural and operational. Some of those changes include

* Cutting one of our redundant vendor contracts saving $80k/year
* Creating automations to decrease customer escalations, saving time for engineers and operators alike
* Reconstructing an entire internal operations website as part of a company pivot (We moved to gatsbyJS)
* Leading weekly engineering-only demos for the engineering organization
* Participating in the Team Bonding Committee for engineering
