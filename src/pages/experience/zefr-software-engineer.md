The highlight of my time at Zefr focuses on delivering a high quality sales tool within 6 weeks on a newly formed team.

Other work I did includes:
- A complete rewrite of internal libraries into TypeScript
- CI/CD Pipeline updates
- Legacy web updates with backwards compatibility
- Migration of test frameworks

My workflow stack here was: React, Typescript, Excel, Node JS;
