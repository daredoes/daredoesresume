During my time at Zefr I have worked on a team focused on delivering a web product called Atrium. As part of this team, I focus on efforts that unblock my fellow engineers, allowing them to deliver their highest quality work with greater ease. Some of this work includes

- A complete rewrite of internal libraries into TypeScript
- CI/CD Pipeline updates
- Legacy web updates with backwards compatibility
- Migration of test frameworks

My workflow stack is: React, Typescript, Excel, Node JS;
