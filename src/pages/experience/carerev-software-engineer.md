I worked on a team that supported clinicians filling shifts for hospital work, as well as improving tools for the operations team that supported these clinicians. These tools were written in Ruby, React, and Elm.

I also spent time working on an internal project utilizing React Native.

My stack here is: React, TypeScript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, React, React Native(Expo);
