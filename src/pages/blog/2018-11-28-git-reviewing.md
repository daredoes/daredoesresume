### Have you ever worked in an environment where pull requests need your review in a timely manner, but there is a lot of traffic on slack, or in emails? 

Worry no more! With this in-progress tool, you can select specific repostiories linked to your github account to monitor for pull requests needing your review! 

This application is written in python, using [rumps](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps), and will eventually be published at least to GitHub open source.
