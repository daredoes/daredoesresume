#### While I attended San Jose State University, some close friends of mine founded the [SJSU Pokemon Club](https://sjsupokemon.club).

I never played an active role in the club, but I was more than happy to help out in [building their former website](https://github.com/daredoes/sjsupokemonclub-site).

This website was a static-site powered by hugo. It displayed the officers, how to contact the club, tournament winners, and an active area for any [Challonge Tournaments](https://challonge.com)
